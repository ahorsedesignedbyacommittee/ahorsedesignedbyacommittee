- German, male, late 30s, works as a lawyer in financial regulation
- Rather a beginner in programming; I'm playing around with small projects in Python and C. 
- Not enough to collaborate on 'real' software, but if someone finds my little projects of interest I'd be very glad about it!
- I write my code mostly in Geany on a Windows 10 desktop (yes, you read that right)
